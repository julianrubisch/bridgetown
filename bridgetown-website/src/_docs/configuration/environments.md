The "environment" of a Bridgetown site can affect the way certain processes work. Typically your site is run in the `development` environment. When running automated tests it should be run in the `test` environment, and upon deployment it should be run in the `production` environment.

When running CLI commands, you can specify the Bridgetown environment by
prepending it to your command:

```sh
BRIDGETOWN_ENV=production bin/bridgetown build
```

or by using the `-e` or `--environment` flag:

```sh
bin/bridgetown build -e production
bin/bridgetown console --environment=test
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment value using your computer or server
settingsâ€¦most hosting companies allow environment variables to be specified via
a control panel of some kind. Or at the command line, look for a `.bashrc` or
`.zshrc` file in your home folder and add:

```sh
export BRIDGETOWN_ENV="production"
```

## Conditional Content

Suppose you set this conditional statement in your code:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% if bridgetown.environment == "production" %}
   {% render "analytics" %}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

When you build your Bridgetown site, the content inside the `if` statement won't be
rendered unless you also specify a `production` environment.

{%@ Note do %}
  If you you're using ERB or another Ruby template language, you can write `Bridgetown.env.development?`, `Bridgetown.env.production?`, and so forth. Refer to the [ERB and Beyond](/docs/template-engines/erb-and-beyond) docs for further details.
{% end %}

The default value for `BRIDGETOWN_ENV` is `development`. Thus if you omit
`BRIDGETOWN_ENV` from the build/serve commands, the default value will be
`BRIDGETOWN_ENV="development"`. Any content inside
{% raw %}`{% if bridgetown.environment == "development" %}`{% endraw %} tags will
automatically appear in the build.

Some elements you might want to hide in development environments include comment forms or analytics. Conversely, you might want to expose an "Edit me in GitHub" button in a development or staging environment but not include it in production environments.

## Environment-specific Configurations

In your `bridgetown.config.yml` config file, as well as the
`src/_data/site_metadata.yml` metadata file, you can add a block of YAML options
per environment. For example, given the following metadata:

```yaml
# src/_data/site_metadata.yml

title: My Website

development:
  title: My (DEV) Website
```

Your site title would be "My Website" if built with a `production` environment,
and "My (DEV) Website" if built with a `development` environment. You can specify any
number of environment blocks that you wish. For example:

```yaml
# bridgetown.config.yml

development:
  unpublished: true
  future: true

staging:
  unpublished: true
```

The `development` environment will build documents that are marked as unpublished as
well as having a future date, whereas the `staging` environment will only
build unpublished. And the `production` environment would exclude both sets.

  #### Top Tip: Accessing the Environment in Your Ruby Code and Plugins

  Anywhere in Ruby code you write, you can check the current environment via `Bridgetown.environment`. You might decide to perform certain tests or verify data or perform some kind of operation in a `development` or `test` environment that you'd leave out in a `production` environment (or visa-versa).
