A couple of brief announcements:

1. The official, production release of **Bridgetown 1.0** will occur some time next week (i.e., before March). So if there are any last minute bugs or major DX enhancements you'd like to see slip in before then, please hop on over to [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) and let us know!
2. We'll be officially ending [our 1.0 fundraising effort](https://fundraising.bridgetownrb.com) at the end of this month. As of the time of this writing, we have reached **$3,763**, or nearly 80% of our goal of raising **$5,000**. Will we at least make it to $4,000 before the final tally? I sure hope so! üòÑ

I soon plan to write up a "debrief" of my thoughts on the fundraiser (which overall I'm very pleased with) and what we might do differently in the future. In the meantime, [please consider contributing](https://fundraising.bridgetownrb.com) to help us shore up our documentation, fix last-minute bugs, and get a polished 1.0 release out the door.

I continue to be gratified hearing all the positive feedback from Rubyists young and ol‚Ä¶erm, vintage üòè as they try out Bridgetown for the first time. [Tweets like these](https://twitter.com/solnic29a/status/1492939392968757249?s=21) are music to my ears. We'll continue to strive earnestly to make Bridgetown the best website construction kit available! ‚úåÔ∏è
